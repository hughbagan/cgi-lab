Question 1
How do you inspect all environment variables in Python?
--------------------
os.environ['VIRTUAL_ENV'] or just os.environ for all of them.


Question 2
What environment variable contains the query parameter data?
--------------------
The QUERY_STRING env variable contains the query.


Question 3
What environment variable contains information about the user's browser?
--------------------
HTTP_USER_AGENT is the env variable that tells us the user's browser
(among other things).


Question 4
How does the POSTed data come to the CGI script?
--------------------
After getting the CONTENT_LENGTH from the environment variable,
it can be read in from stdin (provided the POST is directed
at the CGI script).


Question 5
What is the HTTP header syntax to set a cookie from the server?
--------------------
It is set as a header, therefore it needs to be put before content type is declared.
"Set-Cookie: name=value"


Question 6
What is the HTTP header syntax the browser uses to send the cookie back?
--------------------
It just says...
`Cookie: auth=True`
Not sure what you mean by "header syntax", but I can see the cookie
in the request headers.


Question 7
In your own words, what are cookies used for?
--------------------
Cookies are for storing persistent information in a browser session
(or also between browser sessions?) that the website will want to
use again later.


Question 8
What is the link to your code on Github?
--------------------

(Optional: capture the cookie using proxy.py)
